# Distance-Meter-using-ATmega32

This project is a **Distance Meter** developed using the **ATmega32 Microcontroller** in combination with the **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** and an **LCD** to display the measured distance. The HC-SR04 sensor uses ultrasonic waves to measure the distance to an object, and the result is displayed on the LCD in real-time.

## Features

- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**: 
  - Measures distance by emitting ultrasonic waves and calculating the time it takes for the waves to reflect back.
  
- **ATmega32 Microcontroller**: 
  - The central controller of the system, processing the signals from the ultrasonic sensor and controlling the LCD display.

- **LCD Display**: 
  - Shows the calculated distance on a 16x2 LCD in centimeters (cm).

- **Real-Time Measurement**: 
  - The system continuously measures the distance and updates the LCD display.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use the **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** with the **ATmega32 microcontroller** to create a simple **distance measuring device**. The sensor works by sending out a pulse of ultrasonic sound and measuring the time it takes for the echo to return. The time is then used to calculate the distance based on the speed of sound.
